## Purpose

This document records the decision to establish HawkinsOperations as the successor organization for governed detection engineering.

This record explains the architectural intent. It is not operational proof and does not promote any runtime, signal, evidence, or public-proof claim.

## What Changed

A single integrated system is being separated into purpose-specific repositories.

Detection source, validation, platform and runtime tracking, proof records, and website rendering are separate truth surfaces.

Each repository owns one truth surface and must not claim another.

## Governance Posture

AI is controlled labor, not authority.

Repo source is not runtime truth.

Runtime state is not public proof.

Evidence-linked is not automatically public-safe.

Public claims require evidence, review, and approval.

Real controls require checks, hooks, CI, or workflows that block, fail, or force correction.

Until blocking controls exist, governance language is soft enforcement.

## What This Document Does Not Claim

This document does not claim:

- production-ready status
- fully rebuilt status
- runtime-active detections
- Current-system ownership of legacy metrics
- local LLMs governing triage
- GitHub or website presentation as proof
- CI-enforced governance unless a blocking control exists
