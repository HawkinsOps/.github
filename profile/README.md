## Current Boundary

| Boundary | Current state |
|---|---|
| Flagship proof path | `HO-DET-001` |
| Public ceiling | `TEST_VALIDATED_SYNTHETIC_SCOPE` |
| Public-safe status | `NOT_PUBLIC_SAFE` |
| Website/GitHub status | Rendering and reviewer routing only |
| Runtime-active public claim | `BLOCKED` |
| Public signal-observed claim | `BLOCKED` |
| Production, fleet, enterprise-deployed claim | `BLOCKED` |
| Cribl-routed, Wazuh-routed, AWS-live claim | `BLOCKED` |
| Autonomous SOC / AI-approved / AI-decided claim | `BLOCKED` |

Website/GitHub rendering is not proof. Public surfaces route reviewers to proof records, validation artifacts, and claim boundaries.

## Fast Reviewer Path

1. Read [Start Here](./START_HERE.md) for the current proof ceiling and blocked wording.
2. Check [Control Status Matrix](../governance/CONTROL_STATUS_MATRIX.md) for what is routing, soft enforcement, or real control.
3. Use the [Cross-Repo Promotion Map](../governance/CROSS_REPO_PROMOTION_MAP.md) to decide whether downstream PRs are required.
4. Review `HO-DET-001` in the [proof repo](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-proof/blob/main/proof/records/HO-DET-001.md).
5. Treat [hawkinsoperations.com](https://hawkinsoperations.com/) as public rendering only, not proof.

## Roadmap And PR Propagation

| Route | Purpose | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| [Organization projects](https://github.com/orgs/HawkinsOperations/projects) | Roadmap and planning route for current work lanes | Project cards are coordination, not proof |
| [PR template](../.github/pull_request_template.md) | Requires future PRs to declare artifact ID, truth surface, proof gate, downstream repo impact, and claim boundary | Soft enforcement until CI or required review blocks unsupported PR bodies |
| [Cross-Repo Promotion Map](../governance/CROSS_REPO_PROMOTION_MAP.md) | Explains when source, validation, platform, proof, or website changes require downstream PRs | Cross-repo alignment follows detection ID, artifact ID, proof gate, evidence reference, and downstream truth impact, not PR number |

## Repo Map

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>.github</strong><br>
      Owns org profile, reviewer routing, and claim-control expectations.<br>

## HO-DET-001 Flagship Path

| Item | Current public boundary |
|---|---|
| Detection ID | `HO-DET-001` |
| Source | Exists |
| Splunk source | Exists |
| Validation | Synthetic validation passed within controlled scope |
| Platform guardrail | Runtime contract exists as a non-promotional guardrail |
| Public ceiling | `TEST_VALIDATED_SYNTHETIC_SCOPE` |
| Public-safe status | `NOT_PUBLIC_SAFE` |
| Public runtime/signal proof | `BLOCKED` |

Private/internal controlled lab runtime match status is tracked separately from public-safe proof. It does not promote public runtime-active, signal-observed, production, fleet-wide, enterprise-deployed, Cribl-routed, Wazuh-routed, AWS-live, autonomous SOC, AI-approved, AI-decided, analyst-approved, or production AutoSOC status.

## Cross-Repo Promotion

HawkinsOperations uses gate-based cross-repo propagation, not PR-number alignment.

A changed truth surface only requires downstream PRs when it affects another repo's owned surface. A documented no-op is valid when no downstream repo is affected.

Use the [Cross-Repo Promotion Map](../governance/CROSS_REPO_PROMOTION_MAP.md) before treating source, validation, platform, proof, or website changes as promoted.

## Real Controls Rule

Docs, READMEs, diagrams, issue cards, and websites are not real controls by themselves.

A control becomes real only when it blocks, fails, or forces correction through required review, branch protection, rulesets, blocking CI, deterministic verifiers, typed claim gates, or another enforceable mechanism.

Green CI/status checks are not merge authority. Codex review is AI labor, not human review authority.

## Doctrine

**AI is labor. Governance is authority.**

**Build loud. Verify hard. Claim tight. Ship receipts.**
