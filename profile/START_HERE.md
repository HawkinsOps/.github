# Start Here

Start here if reviewing HawkinsOperations.

HawkinsOperations is a governed detection-engineering system that lets AI accelerate security work while evidence and human review authorize claims.

The enterprise AI failure mode is that AI-generated output becomes a public claim, analyst conclusion, operational action, security disposition, or executive truth before evidence and human review authorize it. HawkinsOperations is built to prevent that promotion path.

HawkinsOperations separates source, validation, runtime, signal, evidence, and public-claim truth. Each truth surface has a different owner and promotion gate.

Website content is rendering only. Repository source proves source existence only.

HO-DET-001 current public repo proof level: CONTROLLED_TEST_VALIDATED.

HO-DET-001 private/internal runtime material: non-public boundary context only.

HO-DET-001 public-safe status: NOT_PUBLIC_SAFE.

HO-DET-001 has merged source, Splunk source, and controlled-test validation artifacts. The public proof record supports controlled-test validation against controlled positive and negative process-creation fixtures.

HO-DET-001 validation enforcement exists through `HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-validation#10`, merge commit `8b48500d2ebbaacd93ac88e77a31dccf1d3b4e25`, only for the exact checked controlled-test validation scope and only where the workflow is required by branch protection or a ruleset.

Proof-loop CI is a real control only where branch protection or a ruleset requires it, and only for the checked controlled-test validation scope. It does not prove runtime-active, signal-observed, evidence-linked public proof, public-safe, production-ready, fleet-wide, Cribl-routed, Wazuh-routed, AWS-live, private runtime host activity, autonomous SOC, or AI-approved disposition.

Platform runtime contract enforcement exists for HO-DET-001 through `HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-platform#5`, merge commit `b3d0ffbd66c1bd5f60f7e9ff99712cdc3e0595bd`. The verifier preserves `CONTROLLED_TEST_VALIDATED`, `NOT_PUBLIC_SAFE`, `BLOCKED`, `runtime_active=false`, `signal_observed=false`, and `ai_decided_disposition=false`.

This platform contract is a non-promotional guardrail. It does not prove runtime-active status, signal-observed public proof, public-safe runtime proof, live Splunk fired, Splunk-proven Runtime Signal 001, Cribl-routed status, Wazuh-routed public proof, production-ready status, fleet-wide coverage, AWS-live status, autonomous SOC operation, AI-approved disposition, or analyst-approved disposition.

HO-DET-001 has private/internal runtime boundary context through validation PR [#22](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-validation/pull/22), proof PR [#14](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-proof/pull/14), and the proof record. This is not public-safe proof and must not be represented as runtime-active deployment, signal-observed public proof, production, fleet-wide, Cribl-routed, Wazuh-routed, AWS-live, autonomous SOC, AI-approved disposition, analyst-approved disposition, or public-safe status.

HOD-001 baseline artifacts do not validate HO-DET-001. They may inform review, but they do not promote the successor detection ID.

Public claims require reviewed wording, evidence linkage, stale review, and approval.
