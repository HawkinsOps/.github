# Issue Factory Control Receipts

Status: STANDING_CONTROL_REGISTER
Control type: governance receipt, blocked-claims register, and enforcement/control-class ledger
Review pass: 2026-05-31 issue-factory pass; 2026-06-01 standing-controls hardening

This file records the receipt-backed governance artifacts produced from the `.github` issue queue and maintains the two standing control surfaces that remain open by design: the blocked-claims register for issue [#10](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/10) and the enforcement/control-class ledger for issue [#8](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/8). It is source truth for the existence of these rows only. It does not prove runtime state, signal observation, evidence approval, public-safe status, production readiness, fleet scope, Cribl routing, Wazuh routing, AWS-live status, live Splunk firing, autonomous SOC authority, AI approval, AI decision, analyst approval, or Project-board approval.

## Standing Control Behavior

Issues [#10](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/10) and [#8](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/8) remain open as standing controls even when this file is current on `main`.

| Standing issue | Durable surface | Why it remains open | Update trigger | Closure rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#10](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/10) | Blocked Claims Register | New proof, runtime, signal, publication, or reviewer wording can create new claim pressure. | Add or revise a blocked-claim row whenever a claim ceiling, evidence requirement, public-safe status, or do-not-claim phrase changes. | Do not close unless Raylee explicitly approves replacing the standing-control role with another maintained artifact. |
| [#8](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/8) | Enforcement Ledger / Control-Class Map | Control classes drift when checks, rulesets, reviews, verifiers, docs, project fields, or public surfaces change. | Add or revise a control row whenever a governance surface becomes report-only, soft-enforced, or fail-closed in a narrower or broader scope. | Do not close unless Raylee explicitly approves replacing the standing-control role with another maintained artifact. |

## Blocked Claims Register

Purpose: advances issue [#10](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/10) by keeping unsupported claims visible as blocked rows.

Boundary: this register proves only that blocked claims are tracked. It does not prove the positive claim in any row.

Maintenance rule: every blocked claim needs claim text, current status, truth surface, evidence required, next gate, control level, public-safe status, whether a hard gate exists, owner decision needed, and do_not_claim language. The main register records the detailed evidence and next gate; the supplemental hard-gate table makes the publication and do-not-claim fields easy to review.

## Enforcement Ledger / Control-Class Map

Purpose: advances issue [#8](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/8) by mapping visible control surfaces to their actual control class.

Boundary: docs, issues, comments, project fields, and reviewer-routing pages are `REPORT_ONLY` unless they block, fail, or force correction. A check is `REAL_CONTROL` only in the exact scope where it is required and fails closed.

### Control Class Definitions

| Control class | Meaning | Reviewer rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NOT_YET_CONTROL | Planned, described, or absent; not implemented as a check, review gate, branch protection, ruleset, or verifier. | Do not treat as enforcement. |
| REPORT_ONLY | Visible in docs, issues, comments, project fields, reports, dashboards, or website pages, but does not block, fail, or force correction. | Useful for review and routing only. |
| SOFT_ENFORCEMENT | Runs, routes, or guides review, but can be bypassed or is not required for the protected path. | Useful control pressure, not fail-closed proof. |
| REAL_CONTROL | Blocks, fails, or forces correction through CI, branch protection, required checks, deterministic verifier behavior, rulesets, or equivalent hard gate. | Real only in the exact checked and required scope. |

| control_id | Control/check/review surface | Owning repo or surface | Artifact path or URL | Control class | Classification reason | What it can prove | What it cannot prove | Enforcement mechanism | Bypass risk | Next strengthening gate | Receipt link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EC-001 | Project #2 fields | Private org project | https://github.com/orgs/HawkinsOperations/projects/2 | REPORT_ONLY | Project fields classify work but do not block repo changes or approve claims. | Board fields exist and can classify issue/control state. | Source truth, validation truth, runtime truth, signal truth, evidence truth, public proof, public-safe status, merge approval, or final disposition. | Manual project metadata. | Board state can drift from repo truth if not reconciled. | Add periodic receipt reconciliation and keep proof authority in repo records. | `gh project field-list 2 --owner HawkinsOperations` observed required fields on 2026-05-31. |
| EC-002 | GitHub issues | HawkinsOperations/.github | https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues | REPORT_ONLY | Issues track work and decisions but do not block branch mutation. | Issue bodies/comments preserve governance intent and close recommendations. | That work is complete unless linked to merged artifacts or approved receipts. | Manual issue triage. | An issue can be closed without the artifact existing unless governance review catches it. | Require closure comments with artifact/PR links. | This file's issue closeout matrix. |
| EC-003 | Issue labels | HawkinsOperations/.github | Repository issue labels | REPORT_ONLY | Labels are visible classification, not a blocking mechanism. | Lane, risk, and review tags. | Claim truth, proof status, public-safe approval, or done status. | Manual label management. | Labels can be missing, stale, or inconsistent. | Add label audit if Raylee wants stronger hygiene. | Open issue metadata observed by `gh issue list`. |
| EC-004 | PR comments | HawkinsOperations/.github | Pull request conversation | REPORT_ONLY | Comments explain scope and recommendations but do not block unless required conversation resolution applies. | Human-readable review context and receipt routing. | That checks passed, claims are promoted, or merge is approved. | GitHub comments plus conversation resolution when configured. | Non-blocking comments can be ignored unless unresolved conversation resolution applies. | Use review-thread resolution and required review when needed. | Branch protection API shows required conversation resolution enabled. |
| EC-005 | PR reviews | HawkinsOperations/.github | Pull request reviews | SOFT_ENFORCEMENT | Main requires PR flow and conversation resolution, but required approving review count is `0`. | Review activity can add visible governance context. | Independent human approval, proof promotion, or production readiness. | Branch protection requires PR reviews object with zero approving reviews and conversation resolution. | Zero required approvals means review quality depends on Raylee governance, not GitHub hard blocking. | Increase required approving review count only with explicit GitHub-settings approval. | Branch protection API observed 2026-05-31. |
| EC-006 | README / START_HERE / wiki docs | HawkinsOperations/.github | `README.md`, `profile/START_HERE.md`, `wiki/11_ORG_SYSTEM_MAP.md` | REPORT_ONLY | Reviewer routing docs describe boundaries but do not fail violations. | Current routes and stated claim boundaries. | Runtime, signal, evidence, public-proof, or public-safe truth. | Source-controlled documentation. | Docs can become stale until reviewed. | Add deterministic wording scans if needed. | Existing files read in this pass. |
| EC-007 | Main branch protection | HawkinsOperations/.github | `main` branch protection | SOFT_ENFORCEMENT | PR flow and conversation resolution are enabled; status checks are not required for this repo. | Direct pushes are constrained by PR-flow settings and admin enforcement. | Claim correctness, proof promotion, or validation success. | GitHub branch protection. | No required status checks and zero required approvals reduce fail-closed coverage. | Add required checks/reviews only with explicit GitHub-settings approval. | Branch protection API observed 2026-05-31. |
| EC-008 | Repository rulesets | HawkinsOperations/.github | GitHub repository settings | SOFT_ENFORCEMENT | Active branch ruleset `org-main-baseline-protection` targets the default branch and requires pull request flow, review-thread resolution, deletion protection, and non-fast-forward protection; it does not require approving reviews or status checks. | PR-flow, conversation-resolution, deletion, and non-fast-forward constraints for the default branch. | Claim correctness, proof promotion, runtime truth, signal truth, public-safe status, production readiness, or validation success. | Active GitHub branch ruleset. | Zero required approvals and no required status checks reduce fail-closed claim-boundary coverage. | Add required checks/reviews only with explicit GitHub-settings approval. | Ruleset API observed 2026-06-01. |
| EC-009 | Command-center invariant workflow in `.github` repo | HawkinsOperations/.github | `.github/workflows/command-center-invariants.yml`; `scripts/verify-command-center-invariants.py`; `governance/COMMAND_CENTER_INVARIANTS.json` | WORKFLOW_CONTROL; real control only if required by branch protection or ruleset | Repo-local workflow and verifier now exist for command-center route files and claim-boundary invariants. | The checked route files, Project #1/#2 boundary wording, proof ceilings, standing-control boundary, private exposure patterns, and blocked-claim context passed the verifier when run locally. | Runtime truth, signal truth, public proof, public-safe status, Project-board approval, merge authority, production readiness, or GitHub settings enforcement. | `python scripts/verify-command-center-invariants.py`; GitHub Actions when triggered. | A workflow that is not required by branch protection or ruleset is workflow control but not necessarily merge-blocking real control. | Make the check required only with explicit GitHub-settings/ruleset approval. | Added in command-center audit upgrade branch; local verifier returned `COMMAND_CENTER_INVARIANTS=PASS`. |
| EC-010 | Referenced validation checks | HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-validation | `governance/ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml` | REAL_CONTROL only in required checked scope | Matrix records validation workflows and verifier commands; real only where required and failing closed. | Checked validation registry/package scope when required checks run and pass. | Runtime, signal, public-safe, production, fleet, Cribl, Wazuh, AWS-live, autonomous SOC, AI approval, or analyst approval. | GitHub Actions/verifiers in owning repo. | Path filters, non-required checks, or report-only mode can limit control strength. | Keep matrix current with observed required checks. | [ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml](ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml) |
| EC-011 | Referenced proof checks | HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-proof | `governance/ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml` | REAL_CONTROL only in required checked scope | Matrix records proof integrity/release checks; real only where required and failing closed. | Checked proof-record integrity and release-contract scope. | Runtime, signal, public-safe, production, fleet, live Splunk, Cribl, Wazuh, AWS-live, autonomous SOC, AI approval, or analyst approval. | GitHub Actions/verifiers in owning repo. | Proof checks prove only checked proof-contract fields. | Keep proof check receipts current. | [ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml](ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml) |
| EC-012 | Referenced platform checks | HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-platform | `governance/ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml` | SOFT_ENFORCEMENT to REAL_CONTROL by check | Matrix records governance gate and dispatch-only local GPU triage; dispatch-only checks are not PR protection. | Platform contract/check scope where required and failing closed. | Production runtime, signal, public-safe, fleet, or AI/human disposition authority. | GitHub Actions/verifiers in owning repo. | Dispatch-only checks can be skipped in normal PR flow. | Promote only approved checks into required gates. | [ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml](ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml) |
| EC-013 | Codex kickoff/closeout logging | Operator logbook | non-public operator logbook | REPORT_ONLY | Operator logging records session chronology and governance scope; it is not public proof. | A controlled session was logged locally. | Source truth, validation truth, runtime truth, signal truth, public-safe status, or issue closure authority. | Append-only operator bookkeeping. | Local log is not a GitHub hard gate. | Keep logs paired with repo receipts when public/reviewer routing is needed. | Kickoff log appended for this pass. |
| EC-014 | Closed-unmerged PR handling | GitHub PR state | Pull request merge state | REPORT_ONLY | Closed PRs without merge are not receipt-backed completion by default. | A closed-unmerged PR may document attempted work or supersession. | That a change landed on `main`. | Manual inspection of PR merge state and replacement links. | Closed PRs can be mistaken for merged evidence. | Require merged commit or replacement receipt link. | Project #2 receipt below. |
| EC-015 | Merged replacement receipt handling | GitHub PR state + source files | Merged PR and changed artifact path | SOFT_ENFORCEMENT | A merged replacement can satisfy an issue only when linked to the issue and artifact path. | The replacement artifact exists on `main` after merge. | Any broader proof or public-safe claim beyond the artifact wording. | Git history plus issue closeout comment. | Replacement may not cover all original done criteria. | Require issue-by-issue closeout comments. | Issue closeout matrix below. |
| EC-016 | Proof records | HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-proof | Proof-owned records and releases | REAL_CONTROL only where required verifier checks fail closed; otherwise REPORT_ONLY to SOURCE_EXISTS by record | Proof records own claim ceilings and can be checked by deterministic proof verifiers, but repo presence alone is not public-safe approval. | The recorded claim ceiling and bounded proof fields in the proof-owned scope. | Runtime activity, signal observation, production readiness, public-safe status, or final disposition outside the approved proof wording. | Proof-record review plus proof integrity checks where configured and required. | A proof record can be stale, unchecked, or broader than its verifier scope if not reconciled. | Keep proof verifiers current and require them only under explicit branch/ruleset approval. | [CONTROL_STATUS_MATRIX.md](CONTROL_STATUS_MATRIX.md) and [ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml](ORG_REQUIRED_CHECKS_MATRIX.yml) |
| EC-017 | Website rendering | HawkinsOperations/hawkinsoperations-website | Public website pages | REPORT_ONLY | Website pages render approved routing/copy but do not create truth. | Public reviewer navigation and the exact rendered wording. | Source truth, runtime truth, signal truth, evidence truth, public proof, public-safe approval, or production readiness. | Website build/checks when they run; rendering itself is not enforcement. | Cached or stale rendering can diverge from proof records. | Link rendered claims to proof records and keep website checks scoped to wording boundaries. | [CONTROL_STATUS_MATRIX.md](CONTROL_STATUS_MATRIX.md) |

## Project #2 Consolidation Receipt

Purpose: advances issue [#39](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/39).

| Field | Observed / recorded value |
| --- | --- |
| Project title | `HawkinsOperations Control Board` |
| Project number / route | https://github.com/orgs/HawkinsOperations/projects/2 |
| Visibility | Private, verified by `gh project list --owner HawkinsOperations --format json --limit 20` on 2026-05-31. |
| Canonical status | Canonical private operating control board for current HawkinsOperations control-board coordination. |
| Proof ceiling | Project metadata and governance classification only. |
| Public/reviewer status | Not public proof. Not public-safe approval. Reviewer route only where explicitly linked and bounded. |
| Required fields observed | `Control Status`, `Lane`, `Truth Surface`, `Control Level`, `Receipt Status`, `Reviewer Facing`, `Proof Ceiling`, `Evidence Link`, `Next Gate`. |
| Additional relevant fields observed | `Repo / Authority Surface`, `Work Lane`, `Truth Boundary`, `Public-Safe Status`, `Runtime / Signal Status`, `Reviewer Route`, `Blocker`, `Next Action`. |
| `.github#6` status | [#6](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/6) is closed, so the issue-#39 "if still open" add-to-Project criterion does not apply in this pass. |
| Stale Project #1 handling | Verified in the follow-up control-surface cleanup pass: org Project #1 was not resolvable through the live ProjectV2 API, and docs now route reviewers to private Project #2 only as the Control Board operating cockpit. |
| SignalFoundry handling | Not verified by this pass; no SignalFoundry claim is created here. |
| Closed-unmerged PR handling | Closed-unmerged PRs are not represented as receipt-backed completion unless a merged replacement receipt exists. |
| Superseded item handling | Superseded items require a replacement artifact or merged PR link before closure recommendation. |
| Public-readiness gate | Privacy review, proof-boundary review, stale review, and Raylee approval are required before any public Project-board exposure. |

### Project #2 Field Semantics

| Field | Semantics | What it proves | What it cannot prove |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control Status | Work-state classification such as Ready, Blocked, Review Needed, Done With Receipts, Closed Not Planned, or Superseded. | Board-level coordination status. | Artifact truth or proof approval. |
| Lane | Work lane such as Control, Enforcement / Verifiers, Blocked Claims, or Proof / Public Routing. | Routing intent. | The lane's work is complete. |
| Truth Surface | The truth surface a card references: repo truth, validation truth, runtime private, signal private, evidence truth, public proof, public rendering, or governance/routing. | Which surface is under discussion. | That the surface is proven or promoted. |
| Control Level | NOT_YET_CONTROL, REPORT_ONLY, SOFT_ENFORCEMENT, or REAL_CONTROL. | Current control classification when kept in sync with receipts. | That enforcement exists without a blocking mechanism. |
| Receipt Status | Missing, Partial, Verified, or Not Applicable. | Whether a card has a receipt classification. | That all done criteria are complete unless linked to the receipt. |
| Reviewer Facing | Internal Only, Public Candidate, or Public Safe After Review. | Intended review exposure status. | Public-safe approval by itself. |
| Proof Ceiling | Text field for the maximum claim ceiling. | The ceiling recorded on the board. | That the ceiling is correct without source/proof verification. |
| Evidence Link | Link to supporting artifact or receipt. | Route to supporting material. | That linked material is public-safe or sufficient. |
| Next Gate | Next owner/action gate. | What must happen next. | That the gate has been completed. |

### Remaining Project #2 Blockers

- Project #2 remains private and must not be described as public proof.
- Project visibility and metadata are not proof authority.
- Public/reviewer exposure requires privacy review, proof-boundary review, stale review, evidence-link review, and Raylee approval.
- Project #1 is not an active reviewer route; live ProjectV2 lookup did not resolve org Project #1 during the follow-up control-surface cleanup pass.
- Board state must not be treated as merge approval, issue closure authority, runtime truth, signal truth, evidence truth, public proof, or public-safe status.

## Dirty Repo State / Repo Hygiene Receipt

Purpose: advances issue [#5](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/5).

| Rule / receipt item | Current receipt |
| --- | --- |
| Dirty repo rule | Before scoped modification, run `git status --short --branch` in the target repo and classify dirty/untracked files. |
| Unrelated dirty stop condition | Unrelated dirty files in the target write repo block mutation. Known unrelated dirty in non-target repos is warning-only unless it overlaps the task, publication claim, proof claim, merge target, or file being edited. |
| Allowed append-only log exception | The governed kickoff/closeout log append in the non-public operator logbook is operator bookkeeping, not repo mutation. |
| Validation command | `git status --short --branch` in the target `.github` repo working tree before branch creation and mutation. |
| Branch safety | Start from clean `main`, create a scoped branch, and avoid branch switching with unclassified dirty state. |
| Staging rule | Never use `git add .`; stage exact changed files only. |
| Proof boundary | Dirty-state classification proves only workspace hygiene for the scoped task. It does not prove runtime, signal, evidence, public proof, public-safe status, production readiness, or issue completion outside linked artifacts. |
| Current `.github` repo status before branch | Clean `main...origin/main`, observed before branch creation on 2026-05-31. |
| Read-only sibling repo status | `hawkinsoperations-detections`, `hawkinsoperations-validation`, `hawkinsoperations-platform`, `hawkinsoperations-proof`, and `hawkinsoperations-website` all showed clean `main...origin/main` in this pass. |
| Close recommendation for #5 | CLOSED_AFTER_PR_42_MERGE because this receipt covers the durable repo-hygiene rule and current scoped status was verified before merge. |

## Issue Closeout Matrix

Purpose: operator map for the currently open `.github` issue queue.

| Issue | Title | Action classification | Artifact produced or linked | Close state | Reason | Required next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#39](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/39) | Project #2 - single control board consolidation | Artifact task | Project #2 Consolidation Receipt in this file | CLOSED_AFTER_PR_42_MERGE | Project title, private visibility, and required fields were verified; source receipt landed on `main`. | No action unless Project route facts drift. |
| [#10](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/10) | Blocked claims register - control board - keep unsupported claims visible | Standing control register | Blocked Claims Register in this file | KEEP_OPEN_STANDING_CONTROL | Issue body/comments define current standing guardrail behavior; the register should remain visible for future blocked claims. | Comment with hardening PR/receipt; leave open for ongoing blocked-claim tracking. |
| [#8](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/8) | Enforcement ledger - control board - map checks to control class | Standing enforcement ledger | Enforcement Ledger / Control-Class Map in this file | KEEP_OPEN_STANDING_CONTROL | Issue body/comments define standing control classification; this ledger should remain open for future check/ruleset drift. | Comment with hardening PR/receipt; leave open for ongoing enforcement mapping. |
| [#5](https://github.com/HawkinsOperations/.github/issues/5) | Dirty repo state - repo truth - classify before writes | Artifact task / repo hygiene control | Dirty Repo State / Repo Hygiene Receipt in this file | CLOSED_AFTER_PR_42_MERGE | The previous blocker was dirty-state classification; scoped repo hygiene rule is recorded and closeout comment was posted. | No action unless repo-hygiene policy changes. |

## Closeout Comment Template

Use this bounded structure for affected issue comments after the PR is opened:

```text
Receipt update:
- Artifact path: governance/ISSUE_FACTORY_CONTROL_RECEIPTS.md
- PR: <PR URL>
- Recommendation: <CLOSE_AFTER_PR_MERGE | KEEP_OPEN_STANDING_CONTROL>
- Boundary: this is governance/control-board classification only. It does not promote runtime-active, signal-observed, evidence-linked public proof, public-safe, production-ready, fleet-wide, live Splunk, Cribl-routed, Wazuh-routed, AWS-live, autonomous SOC, AI-approved, AI-decided, or analyst-approved claims.
```

For `.github#8` and `.github#10`, use `KEEP_OPEN_STANDING_CONTROL` unless Raylee explicitly approves a replacement standing-control artifact.
